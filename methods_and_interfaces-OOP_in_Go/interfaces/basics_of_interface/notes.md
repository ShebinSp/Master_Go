# Interface

* Interfaces is a core concept in Go and interfaces are everywhere.

* An interface is a collection of method signatures that an object which is most of the time a named type, can implement.

* Interfaces define the behaviour of an object and can achieve polymorphism.

* Interfaces are not generic types like in other languages like Java.
