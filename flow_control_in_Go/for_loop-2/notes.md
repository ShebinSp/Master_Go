### While loop in Go

**In fact Go doesn't have the while keyword to construct the loop but we can construct a loop that has the same effect as the while loop in other programming languages using a for loop.**

* A `while` loop can be constructed in Go with the same `for` statement.

* If we skip the 'initialization statement' and the 'post statement' of a for loop, we get a while loop.
