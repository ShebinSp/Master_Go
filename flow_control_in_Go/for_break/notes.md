### Break Statement

* **The break statement is traditionally used  to terminate the inner most `for` or `switch` statement.**

* The break statement is not terminating the program entirely. It is jumping out of the loop and the program continues at the statement following the ending curly braces, so the program will continue from the next statement of the ending curly braces.
