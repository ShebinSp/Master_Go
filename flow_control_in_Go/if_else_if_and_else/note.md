### If, else if and else statements

* If, else if and else statements that are used for decision making.

* This is program control flow in general and allows us to have logic in our application and execute a block of code only when if some criteria are met.

* Only boolean expressions can be used in ' if statements ' in Go. Thing like the truthiness of a variable, like in Python or in Java, is not in Go.

`if some_conditions_is_true {

      // execute this code

} else if {

      // execute this code

} else {

       // execute this code

}`
