### Continue Statement

* **The `continue` statement which works just the same as in C and Java continue with the next iteration of the loop, or, in other words, returns the control to the beginning of the for loop.**

* The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop.

* Usually the continue statement is useful when you want to skip the remaining code in the loop and continue the iteration.
