Buffered Writer(`bufio.Writer) : It's an abstraction provided by Go's `bufio` package.
Instead of writing directly to the file every time you call `Write` , which can be slow 
because it involves interacting with the operating system frequently, 
the buffered writer gathers the data you want to write into a buffer, a temporary space in memory.
