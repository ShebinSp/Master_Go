# Write a byte slice to a file

* The reader and writer interfaces in Go are abstractions used to read and write to files.

* We can  simply read and write bytes without the need to understand where or how the reader gets its data, or where the writer is sending the data.

* A defer statement defers or postpones the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.

* byte slice : byte slice is just like string but mutable, means you can modify each byte or rune.

* All go executables are statically linked binaries, and every package you import increases the size of the executable.
