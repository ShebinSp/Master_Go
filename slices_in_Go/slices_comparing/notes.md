### Comparing Slices

* Comparing slices is a tricky operation in Go.

* Slices can only compared to nil, can compare two slices if they are nil.

* To compare two slices we use a for loop to iterate over the slices and compare element by element.

* When comparing slices, always remember to compare the size or length of slice using len() function.
