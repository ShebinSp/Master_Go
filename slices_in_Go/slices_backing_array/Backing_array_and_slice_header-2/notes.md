* To Create a complete new slice from an existing slice or a copy of an existing slice we should use the append() function.

* In the slice header the address of the backing array, which is a pointer, is the address of the first element of its backing array.

* To check the memory size of any variable including arrays and slices use the `unsafe.Sizeof()` function.

* The slice occupies less memory than an array.
