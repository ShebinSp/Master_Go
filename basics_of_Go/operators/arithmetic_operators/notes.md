#### There are the following arithmetic operators:

    * The `+` operator also applies to strings to concatenate strings.

* `-` (subtraction)

* `*` (multiplication)

* `/` (division)

* `%` (modulus or simply mod)

* **There is no operator for power in Go. Use function math.Pow() to calculate power.**
