### Logical Operators

 **Logical operators applied to boolean values and yield a result of the same type as the operands which is bool. The right operand is evaluated conditionally. There are 3 types of logical operands**

* && (conditional and ) : The evaluated expression is TRUE only if both sub expressions are TRUE.

* || (conditional or) : If any of the expression is evaluated to TRUE, then the entire expression is evaluated to true.

* ! (not or logical negation) : !(not) operator evaluates the expression and assigns as not or opposite of the statement.
