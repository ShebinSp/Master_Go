# Anonymous Functions

* Besides regular functions Go language provides a special kind of function known as anonymous function.

* An anonymous function is a function which doesn't contain any name and is declared inline using a function literal.

* Anonymous functions can be used to form closures.

### Use case of Anonymous Function

* When we return a function which is defined inline inside another function. In Go a function can return another function and can also take as argument a function.

### First Class Functions

* A language which supports first class functions allows functions to be assigned to variables. The case here passed as arguments to other functions or returned from other functions and Go has support for first class functions.
